# Web2

This challenge presents us with a login form. We don't have credentials for this form so we can try to perform an attack called SQL injection. 

We can guess that the server is running the following SQL query to check if our credentials are stored in the database.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '<our input>' AND password = '<our input>';
```

This is an insecure query as we can add a single quote, `'`, into our payload and escape the query, thus altering what the database returns.

If we alter it to always return true, we can log into the website with ease.

`OR` will create a new condition in the statement and `1=1` always evaluates to true. We can use `--` to start a SQL comment which cancels out anything else in the query.

This gives us the following query which will always evaluate to true:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'Admin' AND password = '' OR 1=1 --';
```
