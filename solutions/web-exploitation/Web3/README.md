# Web3

This is a very basic local file inclusion vulnerability.

The filename parameter displays the file that's being included in the webpage. There is likely a line of PHP code that looks as follows:

```PHP
<?php include($_GET['filename']); ?>
```

If we alter the filename parameter to something that refers to an absolute path, the server will include it for us. Therefore, if we make a request to:

http://bootcamp.ctf.cuctf.io:7200/index.php?filename=/flag.txt

The flag should be read and included into the page.
